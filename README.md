i want to kick the interactivity up a notch

clicking on a bar
	grey out all other heatmap columns
	set scale on just that column

clicking on a segment
	grey out all other rows
	set scale on just that row






misc
	change bar DoD to a region in the top left
	mouseover outline on piechart
	correct segment mouseover values (and change to percents)
	does the gradient represent the middle values correctly?
